# Number Staircase

Prints a number staircase using nested loops.

## 📌 Description

The function `printNumberStaircase` builds and prints a staircase of numbers.

Each row:
- starts with its row index
- contains as many numbers as the row number
- increases each next number by 1

The solution uses nested `for` loops and prints each row using `console.log`.

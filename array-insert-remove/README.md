# Insert and Remove Array Elements

Modifies an array by inserting, removing, reordering elements and trimming its length.

---

## 📌 Description

The task performs several operations on an array:

- Removes the first element
- Adds two elements to the end
- Moves the second element to the end
- Removes elements from the end until the array length is less than or equal to 5

The solution uses recursion to trim the array length without using loops.
